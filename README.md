## ðŸ’¸ Arka

Arka paymaster is an open source piece of infrastructure which is a vital piece of
the [ERC-4337 stack](https://www.erc4337.io/). 

Paymasters are what is needed to sponsor users 
transactions.

The flow is as follows:
- Use Etherspot's hosted version of Arka (https://arka.etherspot.io/) or deploy your own.
- [Whitelist](https://etherspot.fyi/arka/api-calls/whitelisting) an address you want to sponsor.
- [Deposit](https://etherspot.fyi/arka/api-calls/deposit) to the paymaster.
- Include the paymaster data in the [UserOp](https://etherspot.fyi/account-abstraction/userops) to have the transaction sponsored.
